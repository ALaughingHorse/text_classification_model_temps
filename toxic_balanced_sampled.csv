The majority of the books i have featuring physical chemistry tell me also that chemical physics seem to be some forms of misprints, or so  there was a story on how someone published the name incorrectly due to the fact they thought it was mostly based in chemistry, so therefore it was chemistry with physics in it; chemical physics.

Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Just to tell you that I cannot tolerate wrong information on wikipedia. 
You guys have to give all aspects of a information, be it good, bad, acceptable, unacceptable, or controversial, without hiding anything to make the information complete.  Wikipedia is the information people trust upon, so it implies that has to be 100% true. Be bold, that is how you can bring a change, you are in the position to do just that.

Ill brainstorm on that until later . I guess add the picture, if it bumps the others too far out of whack we can resize it or when the story gets fleshed out a little, maybe it will balance itself out more. The third option is we can fill out some sections more . Make it more balanced and then add the zines' photo, after, so it Accentuates and isn't the meat and potatoes of the section .  the sections of """"influence on other genres"""" .

You should, perhaps, check out the articles from the U.S. Dept of State. There is one on human rights in DK and one on religious freedom. This is factual, academic work, and it is far more damning that anything I have written (yet). I will soon be incorporating some of these new findings provided by the U.S. Dept of State and the U.S. Ambassador to DK into this Wikipedia article.

If DK has a policy of religious freedom, yet officially have a program of harassing immigrants, that will not gain any favor in terms of international relations. It is virtually impossible to have an article that is factual and also presents a view that the Danes are victims of Muslim invaders, because the facts do not support this. You have a bias towards a sanitized version where the DPP is just a conservative party, and then you and your co-horts choose to delete their racist statements made in Parliament and just about every fact that makes Denmark look bad. It's unfortunate that the truth and facts make DK look bad, but it is what it is... The U.S. Dept of State reports are far more damning, and if you think that is biased, it is in fact you who are biased. Please keep your opinions between your underground """"conservative"""" groups.

1. Inline citations are not required by policy

No policy requires inline citations. They are often a good idea, and are a requirement for feature article status, but it is not a requirement for all articles. Furthermore, the tag is often used when the article has adequate sources. This tag therefore enshrines a particular editor's view about style (that the article in question should have inline citations) in an inappropriate way. That point belongs on the talk page, not in the article itself. Robert A.West (Talk) 

    Where does it say that featured articles have different requirements then other articles? Jeepday 

        The whole point in to get citations for all articles so that they meet the WP:V requirements, I have noticed that tags quite often help by bringing this to attention of users, particularly new-ish users. Cheers SeanMack 

            I agree with Jeepday and SeanMack. Our ultimate goal should be for every article to be of FA quality.  Satori Son 

                That goal is not consensus among editors. But more importantly, inline citations for every fact are not an FA requirement; see WP:FA? section 1c. CMummert · talk

 Zora and Aiden, You, being Non-Muslims, assume being all-knowing about Islam and consider me as an ignorant Muslims who misinterprets his religion. Thanks really for your kind attitude. I was talking at an scholarly level, quoting verses from Qur'an; You can not revert my edits wholesale just because you don't like them and post your own interpretation there. I don't like to get into a revert war though I am pretty sure that my edits are quite justified and I will be the one who will eventually win the debate. You can always add the POV tag to the section and try to find the opinion of other scholars or quote other qur'anic verses. Regarding your point; doing """"original research"""", I would like to say that it is just an excuse and maybe a good strategy to quite the beginners. If we REALLY don't want to do ANY original research, many parts of many articles in wikipedia should be deleted. All the articles will become mere quotes from several scholars without any glue to keep different quotes together. You statement that I am doing original research is by itself an original research!!

Compare that death toll to capitalisms shining beacons of the world; the USA executes an extremely thin ammount of killers compared to this. There IS something wrong with being a communist.

You leftists complain about capitalist nations (of which Nazi Germany WASNT) abusing the proletariat, take a look at your happy and caring communist nations.

 The Burke Group 

In response,  I never provided where he went to school.   I added  he is a J.D.    RAther than delete he is a J.D. (Juris Doctor)  then refer to him as Dr.  David Burke?  A J.D. is a Doctor of Jurisprudence same as a Ph.D.   Why do you allow personal information that's good for you but not for others who might be interested in knowing more?  He was important enough to post an article so why do you think any reader will be satisfied with a sum total of data saying  he owns a rental property in Agoura Hills with a meaningless political contribution?  The property posted is a rental  where he no longer lives and maybe never did.   How is that useful in an article about organized labour? You said it yourself the article should be about the company.  But in actual fact, he IS the company.    He's a flight instructor whom I know from our FBO (Flight Base Operation).  Lots of people know him.   He hasn't contributed to Republicans for years.  Look at the site you  provided!!  Last one was 2004.  Why continue to keep outdated useless information?  The article cited by Dr. John Logan, a very learned fellow, contains some useful info but also contains factually incorrect information. Even he can make mistakes.   I am a lawyer and Logan is a British economist, and may understand E.U. law but does not understand U.S. labor law.  Just because he writes about it does not mean he understands it.  There is NO newspaper article about CDN that says employees were awarded from the Court of Appeals.  He wrote incorrectly.    The citation provided which corrects his article  is  from the court dockets.  Which is a better citation?    I provided the citation from  the law firm that WON the civil case against CDN!!   I removed nothing  about the case itself.... only corrected the information in such a way that the non legal lay person could understand the fundamental differences between NLRB law and DOL law and civil actions filed with the District Courts.   What John Logan wrote that you cite is liking saying someone was cited by the F.A.A. but tried at the D.M.V.!!!  Are you British?  F.A.A. is Federal Aviation Admin. and D.M.V. is Dept. of Motor Vehicles.  They are not related anymore than NLRB is to District Court or civil cases..   Burke works in NLRB jurisdiction and the case you cite is a Civil Action in District Courts not related.    If you want CDN  discussed,  first part is fine but the civil action is not.  there should be another topic developed in wikipedia for CDN.    Logan's article  used as a citation  lacks any credible legal citation connecting Burke to the civil case.   Only a legal citation should be used.   There are none available.    DJB is a very well known person and lots of lawyers both company and union know him. No matter which side of the aisle...this information is flawed.    If you are going to discuss legal issues then get them right.  Am I being picky?  Yes.  Inside the law you can't just throw something at the ceiling and hope it sticks.   Deleting FACTS for FICTION is beneath the dignity of what Wikipedia has strived to promote.    Why do you say the article contains everything anyone needs to know to justify deleting contributions?   How is that possible when Wikipedia is an opened forum for knowledgeable people to build and add more?  You think the sum total for the reader should be that Burke owns a rental property in Agoura HIlls?  How is that related to THe Burke Group?  Please stop  the generalities and provide  3 facts I contributed and tell me EXACTLY how the citation or """"tone"""" can be improved and let me do that.

Hey Merzul, glad you have a sense of humor too.  There is actually a policy that admins are supposed to follow when a block might be controversial.  Obviosuly the admin in question and I have not seen eye to eye on the talk page of an extreemly controversial subject.  According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me.  He did not do that.  He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do.  And """"Final warning"""" suggests a previous warning had been given.  I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WP:Soapbox as an excuse.  Oh well, what are you gonna do.  The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave's talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think).  He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too.   I suspect the """"batman"""" comment sent him over the top (I'm Batman).  But we have one guy claiming he's a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too) who claims he's a doctor and has proven evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I'm batman was just as relevant (shhh mum's the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter).  The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they can/have proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to one's own authority.  But, in Nightguy's eyes I guess you can claim you're a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy.

Taking out the entire Santa Fe Public Library system is a great preemptive strike also. There may be others of his kind, that sympathize with those """"Indians"""".

The place to talk about this is on the massacre talk page but I think you should read the archives to this page very carefully because the problem with the word massacre is exactly the same as with the word WP:TERRORIST a word with intrinsically negative connotations that are generally applied to the actions one's enemies and opponents.

Do you think we should have a page on """"Carnage"""" and """"Bloody slaughter"""" as well as massacre? If not why not?

I would go through others but lets skip strait to the categories you have suggested. For example there is a strong case for saying that many massacres are not """"Human rights abuses"""" because the term is attached to many events that are not, or were not human rights abuses. For example there is nothing in the dictionary definition that stops any mass killing within the laws of war being described as a massacre but that is not a human rights abuse, or are you going to make up a roll you own definition?

 I  define ignosticism as the notion that as His attributes are incoherent and contradict each other, He is meaningless, conrary to my friend David Ramsay Steele who finds Him understandable. What I mean is that whilst one can fathom the  definitions of His attributes and Him, their incoherence really means that He means nothing.
 David states that had scientists resorted to verification, they'd have overlooked atoms and now- superstrngs,  but right before that he states in principle. Indeed, those two matters in principle were knowable whilst God defends on theologian's it must be's and guesses [ John Hick really guesses in dealing with the problem of evil1]. 
 I find as arguments for Him beg the question, such notions as First Cause are meaningless such that theistic arguments themselves affirm ignosticism or in this case, kake it igtheism.
 Google the ignostic-Ockham to get others and my take on it and on the Ockham.
  And I  find it underpins all atheism as one of the naturalist arguments.

Vulcans and Victors (as tanker aircraft) were used in the 1982 Operation Black Buck missions so I am wondering why this article refers to the aircraft being in service 1958 and 1956 respectively. Three Vulcans XM597, 598 and 607 are identified in the Operation Black Buck article as being involved in operational bombing missions. The article on the Handley Page Victor states that it was retired nine years after the last Vulcan. Unfortunately, the Vulcan article does not give a last operational use date, although note should be taken that, according to the article, the last production Vulcans were delivered to the RAF in January 1965. Can someone clarify the dates and modify the dates in the relevant articles please? Vulcans and Victors must have been operational in 1982. If the Vulcans were retired immediately after the Falklands War (1982), Victors must have been operational until 1991. It seems to me that there are so many inconsistencies that clarification is essential to meet the Military History project objectives.",0

This whole conversation is rediculous as the colors on a flag are meant to represent different ideas or ideals.

By calling it yellow one is neglecting to fully appreciate the meaning behind the choice of gold as a flag color is meant to convey an idea, that of eternal and original wealth and prosperity. It has nothing to do with being high and mighty regarding the naming of a color. That is a reactionary and frankly stupid position to hold. Flags are symbols meant to illustrate various ideas and they use images and colors, like all other forms of symbolism, to do this.

Hi again dear

yes I strongly support independence of """"south Azerbaijan"""" from Iran, If Green movement could change somethings, probably I would change my idea, but I dont want to be under Islamic rejim anymore and I support the changing of destiny of Azerbaijani people.

And about """"Azerbaijanis are Turks or not"""". Despite you are talking about Persian theory of the roots of Turkish people, we all know that Turks started to migrate here circa 1000 ad when Saljuk Turks of west branch(Oghuz)started to come, but infact it is not important when they came here. The important thing is """"EVERY ONE"""" in Azerbaijan feel themselves as Azerbaijani( and not Azeri which is an invented word by Persians) Turks and believe that they r Turks and speak Turkish lang. as same as Turks of Turkey. You can come here and ask yourself one by one, you will see. It is so irrarational to say to some one that:"""" No, you r not Turk, you dont know who you are! I know! you r Azeri and Azeris are indoeuropean."""" Pls dont tell us who we r! let us to identify ourselves and we identify ourselves as a Turk whatever others like or not. 

About Aran, as I know we didnt have """"Eyalat Aran"""" in the Qajar era. We had """"Eyalat Azarbaijan"""" and both Azerbaijan rep. and Armenia was part of this big Eyalat as well as south Azerbaijan. Aran was part of this big land. But the important thing is, the name of land is not important here as well, the important thing is the people who live in Azerbaijan rep.( former Aran as you called) are of my race and we r same nation. You may call there Azerbaijan or Aran but the important thing is: """"here a nation live which called themselves Azerbaijani Turks!"""". You may call them whatever you want as well as their land, the important thing is what they call themselves. If they change the name of their republic, will you satisfy? what about next? will you ask them to call themselves """"Arani"""" and start to speak """"Aranian"""" language! which does not exist! 

Ok let's think Azerbaijanis r not Turk, so what they r? Azeri? Ok, let's call them Azeri, what is the next step? You will ask them to forget to speak in Turkish language and start to speak Persian? Or not, speak Azeri lang.? So what is Azeri lang.? where is it? Can you learn it to about 32 million people? let's thing pragmatic as well as rational. Even if your theory of roots of this people is correct historically, you cant ask them to speak neither a lang. of 1000 years ago nor Persian.

Also I dont rely neither to researches of Kasravi nor Zehtabi cos both were under some believes of their backgrounds and governments. One was Paniranist other was Panturkist. Some of their researches looks really funny!

About the names of Turkish places and cities, I guess you have never ever travell to Azerbaijan. If you were here, you'll see that Iranian government has changed the names during Pahlavi era! Some of them are such a funny thing that r jokes between us. for example Tabriz has a suburb in Western part of the city called """"Akhmagaya"""" which in Turkish means the rock which falling down and it is a rocky place, do u know what is its official name? """"Ahmagiyyeh!"""" the lands of stupid people! All of the Turkish names tried to change to a Persian words which looks verbally simmilar them! The fact is Persian never have been to Azerbaijan. Most of the Azerbaijani names have Armenian or Tat roots not Persian. My believe is that a mixture of differnet natios like Tats, Armenians, and other caucasian tribes lived here and then Turkish tribes of western branch have migrated to this land in large size and get married with the native people and has made the new nation which called Azerbaijani Turks nowadays.

I told you history is not important than today, the important thing is every one here feel themselves as a Turk. I dont know what they want us to feel in Tehran!

The name of Azar abade gan looks wrong as well. This word cant change to Azarbaijan during history. I guess the word was """"Azar pay gan"""" (maybe) which zoroastrian Persians called, not Azar abad gan which Ferdowsi mentioned in Shahnameh and everyone got to accept it now!

I am slowly working on many of the mountains of Washington.  I do one or two a day.
I have identified a list of notable mountains that pages will be created.  One is a list of highest points in each of Washington's 39 counties.  I research if they need disambiguation.  So for Big Horn mountain I had to research whether there were other things called Big Horn - there are tons of them.  As you can see there are hundreds of uses of Big Horn.  If I can, I find newspaper articles relating to the place.   But due to the literally thousands of misspellings of bighorn sheep, businesses and other things like transformer toys and a ship... I have not been able to isolate one article about Big Horn.  Big Horn so far is not notable for much of anything besides being the highest point in Lewis County, Washington.  But I did find a couple of trip reports.

 Penmon, Anglesey 

Hi there.  You may have noticed that I've been adding to the excellent article you created here - a few extra refs and some photographs, plus an infobox as suggested by a reviewer.  (Oh, and I renamed it too!) Can you think of anything else that can be added at the moment?  I would be interested in nominating it for an assessment for Good Article status - I haven't done this before, but it seems to comply with the criteria (or to be nearly there, anyway).  What do you think?   

You baked the cake, I just added the icing!  Fingers crossed...  

 Oh dear... 

This might interest you.  

 Re: (WP:HD) TOTD 

I was wondering about that, too. Wikipedia talk:Tip of the day would be the appropriate place to bring this up, but I don't think it's very active. Other than that, the admin's noticeboard or miscellanious Village Pump may be places to bring it up that would get a faster response.  15:59, 18 May 2007 (TC)

 Penmon revisited 

Hello again.  The GA review picked up various points, some easy to fix, some not.  Anyway, I've had a go and fixing things and I think it could do with your further attention to see whether you can spot anything that I've missed, particularly points 1, 5 and 7.  Then perhaps it'll get its GA badge!  

Great work.  I've renominated it and left a message for our previous reviewer, as he offered to look at it again if nobody else did whilst he was away.   

Good news! I think that means that you and I are entitled to display this  as a reward for our hard work.  Right, where's next?!

They control what version of the truth you see here. The sad fact is, you don't have a fucking clue about what I've been doing.

Back in the real world - see all that evidence on Wikipediocracy - I've been trying to post that here from day one, because I came up with it. The reason why you can't see it anywhere here, is because corrupt bastards like Future know that for every Wikipedian who has a clue, there's plenty who are as retarded as you, and will believe him when he says it never existed, and that I'm a troll. I can't spell it out any more clearer than this - he never wanted Betacommand banned, he never wanted Werieth exposed.

While first reading this article I was slightly overwhelmed with the amount of information. However as the article progressed, I continued to see an increasing amount of methods (both right and wrong) that I recognized from first hand experience. Throughout high school I was continuously asked to tutor children (typically students between first and fourth grade) and so one of the most commonly used methods was the additive method. The children I tutored, especially the younger ones, found it difficult to distinguish when to use the multiplicative method versus the additive method. Originally I found this frustrating but reading this article, and in particular the section on the ‘Mr. Short and Mr. Tall’ experiment, made it clear as to why the kids didn’t understand. 

I am also studying astronomy in which we are studying Newton’s universal law of gravitation and hence this was one of the more interesting and appealing sections of the article for me. That being said, I think the author could have expanded upon this example by describing, for instance, the inverse square law in which tripling the distance between the objects would weaken the force of gravity by 3^2 and explaining so people who haven’t covered the subject would understand.",0

The way wiki immediately took down the 8 prime spirals pages and the minor referer pages about the person that discovered it way back in 1995 who also has a new project known as HelixQ is a joke.

Let's see the argument of wiki is that the 8 Prime Spirals are not 'peer reviewed', in academia anything involving crypto and national security has been censored for decades and in 1995 when the original paper came out revealing numerous new prime theory that was years ahead of prime theory then, there was no way for such work to even be published, so USENET was how it was distributed, and it's a fact usenet has been heavily edited involving the topic.

Now you can all point to your rules about 'peer review' but this shows how ignorant everyone thus far is about academia and censoring of math involving primes and crypto. Let's see wiki has a page on Dr. Bernstein, a guy that took the NSA to court in 1995 the same year the paper was released, so that's how restricted publishing prime theory as it relates to crypto was in 1995, and is still today.

You expect NSA funded journals like AMS to allow such information to be 'peer reviewed'?

Anyway, my original article was 'heavy handed' killed by 'mods' at wiki and if you don't think the NSA has infiltrated wiki and almost every type of mass social media on the net (and yes to me wiki is a social media/project) then you need to read on the Snowden documents.

So the article put a light on some very interesting 'prime theory' that is supported by GitHub, anyone can check the github cite to see the info that every so-called prime algorithm and many have pages on wiki, all failed to outperform a 2300 year old algorithm, aka sieve of Eratosthenes, all expect for one algorithm, a prime spiral algorithm that I KNOW has been around since 1995 and a theory that has been heavily censored by the NSA since almost any reference to the many posts about ENNISA Prime Formula has been erased from Usenet, the original 'social media' of the net.

That all being said, I'm constantly now being 'threatened' by who? Mods that think me insisting the removal of the original page is suspect to obvious manipulation most likely by the NSA?

Prove wiki has no NSA bots or mods controlling the discussion, put the page up and let it be edited properly. 

The original article was what I would think any real mod not working for the NSA would agree was pretty NPOV, and the 'cite' to github verified the whole claims, that a new prime algorithm is beating all known prime algorithms, something the other wiki page prime algorithms do not do.

The original article referenced the discover is connected to obvious 'disinfomation' as well, and the continued supression of anyone discussing his work and him as was done by wiki in this article is defacto proof that the PTB want to keep the public and academia in the dark about significant advancements in prime theory.

Anyone can google NSA and the major journals you think are 'peer reviewed', what do you see searching NSA and AMS, oh it's funded by the NSA. LOL

That's your 'peer review', so any real mod here can step in and put the original article back. The PyPrimes test of the algorithm shows how major this work is.

Then the public can decide who discovered it, I know the origin is 1995 and 1997, I've been following it that long, and to see wiki put up pages about a slow 60Mod algorithm from 2004 that was discussed in the same prime work in 1995 is a joke.

Then you start to peel away who are the guys involved in all this new crypto and prime work and you start to see nothing but NSA funded projects.

What you don't think the NSA had laws in place for decades banning such work? They did. And now they control the academic journals with funding to furthr control what is released about anything that can impact crypto and the heart of crypto is what, PRIME NUMBER THEORY.

The mere fact that a project that is open to PUBLIC SCRUTINY by competent computer programmers has shown for over two years a new prime algorithm is the so-called king of the hill of prime theory, and wiki mods and most likely NSA/wiki mods are doing their best to treat the PyPrimes speed tests like they are insignificant.

The fact is PyPrimes exposed how advanced the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni was by it beating all the major prime algorithms.

The fact is PyPrimes referred to the 1995 30Mod Prime algorithm as 'Croft Spirals', which is a joke since Croft created his site about the theory in 2010, then in 2012 PyPrimes picked it up, and now wiki is saying so what, there's a new prime algorithm that dethroned every prime algorithm wiki has pages on.

Reading back on racist, Amandajm - I've come to realize that in addition to his muslim name, he veritably hates white people. He deletes info about european history even if such info is based upon accurate inferences. Why he does this should be the subject of debate. My theory is that he's jealous of white culture and history being that he's muslim. Also, it's important to note that muslims of his poor ilk who exhibit such hatred additionally exude homosexual frustrations. This is well documented in psychiatric circles. Why a dirty, white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is WAY beyond me. If he wants to write about muslim history, he should. But, he shouldn't be given the chance to write about something he obviously knows nothing about and DOES NOT pertain to him. This guy IS NOT european. Honestly, he doesn't deserve to be on wiki at all. 'Stay on your side of the fence', is a motto I always quote.

To that, yesterday I followed up by sending emails to Homeland Security and the FBI Counter-terrorism Division for investigation into who he is and what his motives are. (No, I've not gone off the deep end). I received an automatic response email from the FBI stating that they will look into the matter, and will definitley be following up. Racist muslims of this type are tricky and can pose a risk to the US. Also, I sent an email to wiki complaining about this enemy of europeans and americans.

Impumozhi and his knowledge (or lack of) about rajputs
 

Incident 1: Impumozhi accuses rajputs of fabricating history on Hada page

Read this page for a little entertainment  in particular, the last three sentences, setting out the historical repurcussions of that hilarious (and probably fictitious) incident. Is this fit for an encyclopedia? Leave aside veracity, just the choice of words? Yet nobody dare change one comma or fullstop in that page: it is """"owned"""" by that presiding deity of obduracy, the learned protagonist of every page with a remote """"rajput"""" connection.

 Impumozhi's lack of knowledge exposed

His claim about Hada's character  being funny and un-encyclopaedic is actually taken from James Tod's Annals and Antiquities page 384 and 385 Vol-II: 
On the death of the queen Joda Bae, Akbar commanded a court mourning; and that all might testify a participation in their master's affliction, an ordinance was issued that all the Rajput chiefs, as well as the Moslem leaders, should shave the moustache and the beard. To secure compliance, the royal barbers had the execution of the mandate. But when they came to  quarters of the Hadas, in order to remove these tokens of manhood, they were repulsed with buffets and contumely. Then enemies of Rao Bhoj Hada aggravated the crime of this resistance and insinuated to the royal ear that the outrage upon the barbers was accompanied with expressions insulting to memory of the departed princess, who it will be remembered was a rajputani of Marwar.  Akbar, forgetting his vassal's gallant services, commanded that Rao Bhoj should be pinioned and forcibly deprived of his moustache. He might as well have commanded the operation on a tiger. The Hadas flew to there arms, the camp was thrown into tumult, and would have soon presented a wide scene of blood-shed, had not the emperor, seasonably repenting of his folly repaired to the Boondi quarters in person. He expressed his admiration (he might have said his fear) of Hada valour, alighted from his elephant to expostulate with the Rao...

If James Tod thinks this incident is worthy of being mentioned in his book, Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan, what is wrong in this incident being mentioned on Wikipedia?

 

Incident 2. Deleted the name of famous rajput lady, Maharani Gayatri Devi, from rajputani page, saying she is not a rajput.

His response: .

Impumozhi, on rajputani page deleted the name of Maharani Gayatri Devi . 
Then he was asked why he did so: .

His response was countered on his talk page:  and till date he has not responded. The reason he did not respond is because his lack of knowledge on the topic was thoroughly exposed.

 

Incident 3: Impumozhi tries to get the page of a famous rajput king deleted, but is thwarted.

In another incident he put a tag of db-nonsense on the article Hammir Dev Chauhan  . 
He was asked on the talk page of this article on why he put the CSD tag: . No reasons given till date. Another user, , had to remove this db-nonsense tag: . Here again Impumozhi had no idea about the subject matter but just because a rajput had created this article he put the db-nonsense tag.",0

The distinction is important; if they are partly descended from Rajputs, who were never really confined to any one part of India, that would explain the linguistic variation within the Indic words in Romani. 

For example, why the use of """"-o"""" instead of """"-aa"""" at the end of masculine nouns/adjectives in Romani?

 According to the Organisation of The Islamic Conference: 
""""Islamophobia signifies the contemporary proliferation of discrimination against Muslims and distortion of Islam and is partly due to the ignorance and lack of understanding of Islam in the West. It would be an unfortunate error in judgment in believing that Islam is linked to terror; that it is intolerant of other religious beliefs, that its values and practices are not democratic; that it favors repression of freedom of expression and undermining human rights.""""http://www.oic-oci.org/uploads/file/Islamphobia/Islamophobia_rep_May_23_25_2009.pdf

Nope, I didn't read the guide to appealing, didn't have time. The user in question IS engaged in harassment, I've been doing this long enough to know and I can prove it. He/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page, reverted the article while I was in the midst of editing it (my second pass, couldn't even preview changes), then changed his/her mind as to my real wiki-sin, since the onus for proving the Doris Day available as PD on archive.org was on him/her not me and the usual span for pre-Bern had expired long ago, ... decided my REAL sin was Original Research (oh noes), and continued to revert based on that. Does OR add clutter? Sure it can, but if the user in question was REALLY concerned about that, about the quality of the article and about extraneous details, WHY DIDN'T HE/SHE EVEN NOTICE two paragraphs already there, comprising about 1/3 of the entire article, dealt with Norman Schwarzkopf, an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? I'll tell you why: the user wasn't engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles. He/she was involved in blocking input to the article. Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I'd guess it's some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying. I don't really have time for this. I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn't directly related to content and improving articles. I could pretend this user didn't do what he/she did, but I'm wasting my own time here and I don't really have a stake in any such pretense. I don't have any stake in improving this article either, no dog in the race, I just see how it can be improved and made more informative. As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don't see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles. The problem isn't me here, it's that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. Also, I don't recal ever having called him/her a bot, I think you put those words in my mouth, perhaps inadvertently. His/her behavior is malicious, but probably not malware, just the normal human collection of problems. I think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper, he/she isn't quite qualified for that at this point anyway, and it's having a very chilling effect across wikipedia. I won't egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms, I will continue to write in English, and to read articles on wikipedia in English, and to think of ways to improve them in English. I am fully aware of how the terms """"vandlism"""" are used and misused here, and most of the rest of the wikijargon. Nothing new under the sun here. If you read the edits I made carefully, and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user, you will see I'm not off the mark here at all. I know what's going on.

Actually, I don't think it's particularly 'enlightening' at all!  First, the essay implies that a person may be inclined to view a number of edits as coming from 'the same person'.  I view that implication as an example of a 'straw-man argument':  A person builds up an (intentionally weak or flawed) argument, solely for the purposes of knocking it down.  That's not particularly enlightening, except that it reveals that people generally have more luck knocking down a position if they've built it up, specially, just for that purpose.
I view the matter more as an example of a commonality of self-selection:  Consider that if you're at the top of El Capitan (natural rock pillar), you will find (generally) two types of people:   1.  Very rich people who can (and do) hire a helicopter to fly there.
2.  Very capable, enthusiastic, and competent rock climbers.
In other words, you don't find there many people who are both poor and handicapped, merely because of where you happen to be.  (and, if you're actually there, chances are that you, too, are either rich or a very good rock climber.  Wikipedia is, quite likely, a 'magnet' for 'control freaks'.  (and others, obviously.)  I've read comments that some editors make tens of thousands of edits.  While I could say, """"Get a life!"""", I don't view such enthusiasm as INHERENTLY bad, wrong, or a problem.  But, I think there may very well be an ASSOCIATION between OCD-type (Obsessive-compulsive disorder) editing, and 'control-freak' behavior.
There are other clues that must be considered.  A person who is acting out a 'control-freak' fantasy, wants to control as much as possible.  Apparently, WP has made it quite easy to 'revert'  to a previous edit.  That ability is not NECESSARILY bad (against vandals), but it implicitly encourages a kind of 'all or nothing' reaction:  If a 'control-freak' wishes to manipulate, as much (and as many) as possible, it's far easier to simply 'revert' ALL of an edit, rather than (carefully and selectively) remove ONLY as much of a 'problem' as actually exists.  Ever heard an old saying, """"When the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to treat all problems as if they were nails.""""  One of the most 'inefficient' routes, from the standpoint of a 'control-freak', is to actually stick around and dispute the propriety of the original edit, and the characteristics of the 'control-freak's actions. 
A 'control-freak' gets his jollies, most readily, by UNdoing what others have done.  (The 'control-freak' feels, explicitly or implicitly, that he doesn't have to 'justify' the status of the article BEFORE his victim's edit!).  If the 'control freak' must actually distinguish between 'proper' posting and 'improper' posting sections, he becomes far less 'efficient' at manipulating others.  (He must spend far more 'valuable' (in his not-so-humble opinion) time READING, and distinguishing, rather than merely reverting!   Consider a hypothetical 'war' between a person who is making a 'house of cards', and another person who views it as his task to impede the first:  The latter person needs merely show up for a second or two, every few minutes, and knock down the 'house of cards'.  Minutes or hours of work is gone, in a moment!  VERY 'efficient', from the standpoint of the 'control freak', but not for his victim.
 Worse, if the 'control freak' must first obtain a CONSENSUS (something which WP ostensibly requires) he is powerfully impeded from excercising his 'control-freak' tendencies.  (I am not considering, here, raw 'vandalism', of course:  Very arguably, it SHOULD be easy to completely revert actual, genuine 'vandalism'.)  It is not surprising, therefore, that 'control-freaks' are far more likely to simply revert ALL of an edit, QUICKLY, preventing consensus, and refusing to justify it in any actual discussion.
Thus, I notice that (in, so far, every case), every 'drive-by deletion' to which I have been a victim involves a person who REVERTS ALL of my edits (Check!), and not merely a portion of them (Check!) and who does so VERY quickly (Check!), who prevents any sort of consensus from forming (Check!), and who doesn't bother to stick around to debate the propriety of the original posting, or the 'freak's' abrupt erasures (Check!).
  Aha!  Things are getting quite clear, at least from the standpoint of the 'control-freak' in question.  But why should a flock of others try criticize the victim, and NOT the 'control freak'?  Is it because I think 'they're the same person'?  ('Straw-man argument')   Noooo!  Consider another saying, """"Birds of a feather flock together"""".   If there were only a single 'control-freak' in the world, nobody else would have any motivation to assist him, or to help victimize his victims.  But there are many 'control-freaks', and each understands that if ONE 'control freak' gets impeded, prohibited, or criticized, or exposed, the next one COULD BE THEM!  After all, I",0

Moreover, Smalley's perception is also that of many other leading authorities on the Gospels in the early church; such as [[Christopher Rowland (theologian)|Christopher Rowland), who may not (unlike Smalley), be specialists in the Johannine literature.  The pespectives reperesented in the article as it is currently, represent (to my reading) one particular strand of the 'redaction critical' approach.  Broadly, this approach shares with Smalley/Rowland, a decreased tendency to regard the Synoptic Gospels as transmitting a 'historical' source.  But the corollary is to treat both the gospel genre; and much of the charactersistic gospel content; as a theological construct - specifically due to the author of Mark.  But if Mark 'invented' the feeding in the wilderness as a theological construct, then the presence of the same story in John shows dependence.  But this view of Mark is not by any means a consensus; many scholars (like Smalley and Rowland) would maintain that there were indeed independent 'historical' accounts of Jesus's ministry and gospel message that preceded both the Synpoptics and John, and provided the basis for their common narrative material.

Unfortunately, you are an undeniable feeble person who misrepresents reality of the Urantia Fellowship as someone who does not legitimately publish the Urantia Book and is a failure with only, as you say hundreds of members. The Urantia Readers-Intl has hundreds of readers worldwide in places such as Denmark, Saudi Arabia, Europe, Korea, etc. Your self repressed reality is necessary for you to get through each day of your bitter resentful life.

This is false. I cannot recall any study which asserts confidently that Palaeolithic Europe was genetically homogeneous. If there is one, it would require in-line citation. I think whoever wrote the sentence has confused themselves. The studies have, rather, shown that Mesolithic Europe became more homogenepus because of population bottlenecking with subsequent expansion.

 Attempt at close of old RfC 

That is, the RfC listed on Archive 4 of this talk page, """"RfC: Does the article minimize the centrality of India to the notion of caste?"""" That the discussion wasn't closed earlier is of little surprise: it is long, it is technical, and the older it gets the less appetizing it gets: such discussions are very much not like Parmigiano-Reggiano. In fact, the discussion is so long that you'll have to accept the general conclusions I think I was able to draw without my being able to point at each and every individual comment supporting it. What I, as a non-Hundi-Indian currently middle-class college professor, conclude, are the following points:
Scholarly consensus appears to be that the caste system is still of the greatest importance to Hindu India; vice versa, discussions of the caste system in secondary and tertiary scholarly sources note the centrality of Hindu India to the very concept of """"caste"""".
Scholarly and especially less scholarly discussions on the concept of caste in other societies, esp. those outside SE Asia, mostly seem to use the term in the """"broader"""" sense signaled in various places in the RfCas a convenient shorthand for """"social stratification"""" and such. I note also that the application of the term """"caste"""" to some other cultures, popular until the 1970s and perhaps after, has now come under (academic) scrutiny and criticism.
Considering those two points, I conclude that it is 
The 1 September 2012 version of the article does suffer from OR and some coatracking; the current version is much better in that respect, though far from perfect. Note, for example, the very loose use of the word """"caste"""" in this newspaper article to warrant the inclusion of Cagot. As it turns out, there are sources """"comparing"""" their segregation to that of the Indian caste system: such a comparison is perhaps valid, but does not itself warrant calling them a caste.

Allow me a few observations and suggestions.
""""Caste"""" should (and this is supported in the RfC) include extensive discussion of the situation in India.
Examples from other cultures (some of which well established and verified in the current version of the article and associated main articles) must of course be thoroughly verified; an article from The Independent cannot suffice for what is, after all, an encyclopedic article.
I believe it is imperative (and comments in the RfC and elsewhere in the talk page archives support this) to come to a clarification of terms. The current lead does some of that already, but a separate section is warranted. Etymology should be the least important part of such a section; more important is a history of the usage of the termnot to be able to list every example of its usage, but rather to sketch the attractiveness of the paradigm to scholars of various periods, an attractiveness that has by now lost some of its currency. Parts of the lead of the 1 September 2012 version point to that as well; what's important is to delineate the term and its currency. Fowler&Fowler; cites Balkin in the RfC (""""social stratification in the United States does not really match the technical definition of caste ... caste is at best an effective hyperbole"""") and it's precisely that kind of research and criticism that need to be used here.
Sourcing should continue to be scrutinizedin Caste system in India, I read """"Caste is neither unique to Hindu religion nor to India; caste systems have been observed in other parts of the world, for example, in the Muslim community of Yemen, Christian colonies of Spain, and Japan"""", with one reference possibly very outdated (1972) and another a newspaper article from the New York Times. This is an article in which Wikipedia's crowdsourcing """"hey it's in the paper let's add it"""" needs to be held in check.

In all, I believe this was an interesting discussion in which the participants are perhaps closer to consensus than they thought. It is clear that there is no consensus that the article is redundant to Caste system in India etc.; it's clear also that there is consensus that the article should be much more focused than the 1 September 2012 version was, and that India must occupy a position of great(er) importance. In various places various quantified suggestions were made; I cannot comment on those numbers. I sensed some hesitance at perhaps """"borrowing"""" material from Caste system in Indiawell, if that's where good content on the concept of caste, its history, and its usage can be found, that's where you go. Good luck.   """,0

In Canada you have  one month to register a child, in Portugal for those born abroad there is no time limit to register. 

I will give you an easy example:  I child born in Canada before being registered is not Canadian? (So , all the children that are born in Canada and die before being registered are foreighners)
  
The problem I have with the consensus version:
1. It is not a consensus, not everybody agrees
2. You were given references
3. Citizenship, as you are aware,it is not the same as nationality. And writing she is Canadian with Portuguese nationality would be misleading too.

 Unneccessary reference 
Is Samurai Champloo important enough to be included in this article? It doesn't seem to add much to the article. Why's every article I look at have some reference to anime?

Why does every other article I read have reference to some American Sitcom or other live-action medium? It's a part of popular culture, that's why. The Sunflower Samurai as well as Sunflowers themselves are a HUGE central plot point that dominates almost every single episode.

So post it in the Samurai Champloo article. Anime is not central nor even moderately relevant to actual sunflowers.

If it is at the end, labeled, and sufficiently known information, why not have it?  

 why do sunflowers """"want"""" to follow the sun?

Heliotropic flowers are more prevalent among plants in alpine areas.

 Replaceable fair use Image:Hidexjapan.jpg 

Thanks for uploading Image:Hidexjapan.jpg. I noticed the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add , without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template.
 On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on [ this link]. Note that even if you follow steps 1 and 2 above, fair use images which could be replaced by free-licensed alternatives will be deleted 2 days after this notification (7 days if not used in an article), per our Fair Use policy.

 Genre changes 

Hi, as you can imagine many people have very different opinions as to exactly what genre their favorite (or least favorite) band belongs in.  The editing and re-editing of genres is a never ending cycle on many Wikipedia pages.  If you believe that the genre is not properly assigned to a band, you may want to bring it up on an article's talk page and try to reach a consensus decision, you may find that the discussion has already begun.  At the bare minumum you should use references to back up your change.  You don't want to be known as a genre troll! If you have any questions please feel free to drop me a line on my talk page.

Firstly, I am not fixated on, nor am I carrying on a dispute with, Epeefleche, and I certainly have no desire to get into any conflict with them. If you are not prepared to accept that then my posting any further unblock request would be pointless.For what it's worth, my attention was drawn to the article in question by additions made by Epeefleche to several golfer biographies which are on my watchlist. I first posted a message on Epeefleche's talk page explaining the minor changes I had made to those additions to those articles to try and negate any potential for conflict. I also explained the obvious issue I had noticed with the inclusion criteria for that list, before posting on the article talk page. I do not think either of those edits were disruptive or confrontational in any way, and thought I had responded in a reasonable manner to all Epeefleche's comments, while trying to return the focus onto the article. I repeat, I do not wish to engage in any dispute or conflict with Epeefleche or any other contributor and that remains the case. I cannot be any clearer on that.I have acknowledged that I should not have engaged in repeated reverting, and I see how that could potentially inflame things even more than usual in this instance.Yes, my response to Greg L was over the top and I should have done as I usually do – don't click the save page button and just ignore it, but it's too late now. bigissue """,0

Well that is not correct. If you are unwilling to learn the difference between in-universe and out-universe then I think editing articles dealing with fictional characters is not fair on editors who actually bothered to. The problem is the date of death field is part of the personal profile section of the info box. This means it is an in-universe element of the article; referring exclusively to events within the series. If the episode was set on a different date, to that it aired on - then a death featured within that episode would carry the date within the series. Fictional characters do not die from our viewpoint - they will always exist, they do not cease to exist, so we do not use our date. So maybe you need to have a rethink.

1) Fine, if """"retort"""" isn't 100% appropriate then I'll use """"counter-argue""""- that is the meaning I was trying to get across.

But I think all your other points are too strict and therefore not in keeping with Wikipedia's guidelines or encyclopedia guidelines in general.

2) You said: """"Christians retort that the messianic prophecies never specified a time-line for the Messiah's actions, and the New Testament, especially the Book of Revelation, detail how some of the prophecies will come to fruition later. . This is a bit vague and raises some questions. Which Christians? Where did they say that? How did they detail it? Can you reference it from a notable/semi-notable scholar?""""

First, I can't point to a place in the Old Testament where the time-line DOESN'T exist, you know what I mean? There is no Jewish time-line so it cannot be referenced. But the New Testament does have a Christian time-line, as detailed in the Book of Revelation. Now, which Christians hold to this belief? Essentially all of them- all that have a moderate to literal interpretation of the Bible, which is essentially all. Where did Christian authors detail this belief? In the Bible! How did they detail it? They wrote it in the Bible!!! That is why I made Bible references! Which scholar can I quote? How about John the Apostle, who wrote Revelation? Is one of the founders of Christianity an acceptable source on the subject?

I find you taking objection to this equivalent to someone writing, """"Christians believe Jesus came back from the dead, as detailed in various places, including the gospels,"""" and then you coming around asking for scholarly sources and not accepting Bible passages and asking, """"which Christians believe that?"""". 

3) You said: This includes Jesus ruling an earthly paradise after the apocalypse (Revelation 19-22). , although it does reference The Bible, if left alone, it sounds rather confusing. It also does not specifically reference a line from Revelation, nor does it reference which version of The Bible it quotes (King James, NIV, etc) which could mean a slight difference in the quote. 

If you want many specific Bible quotes then I'll put those in, and I'll list if its KJV or whatever. But I don't think that's required as my broad citation of Rev 19-22 does clearly explain exactly what I'm talking about, including a physical kingdom on earth, a messianic age of righteousness and so on. Just because I didn't dissect it and show a specific line for each point doesn't mean they aren't there- any interested reader can easily find them by reading those chapters.

If I had written, """"The story of Noah's Ark is in Genesis 6-9,"""" would you have deleted my entry and said its citation is too vague? Just because I didn't give a synopsis with ten references doesn't mean it's unworthy; just look it up! 

4) What bothers me most is how this whole thing started when I tried to correct incorrect data on your site (the line that Christians don't believe in a physical resurrection). That line had NO references! So even if my references are vague they still trump the initial post, don't they? You can't delete my post for dubious citation then restore something with no references at all.

5) I'm sure you'll disagree with me on this one, but most of all, I think that my contribution didn't need to cite ANYTHING as it is such common knowledge that Christians believe in Judgment Day, an age of peace etc. I feel like I'm in some kind of twilight zone defending this belief. 

It's almost as bad as someone posting, """"Christians don't believe Jesus was tried, executed and came back to life,"""" then I post that they do, citing Luke 20-24, then you saying that it is too vague etc. It was pure courtesy to give the citation- it's such common knowledge that Christians believe these things!

But whatever- I'll repost with a several more-specific quotes. And BTW, you may think, """"Whoa, this guy care WAY too much about Wikipedia (and I'm a mod),"""" but this is about preventing my religion from being misrepresented. (And I hate inconsistency.)

20044,20044,"""

I have found the original answer in the archives garbage historic, after intervention of Töbel, here it comes:

 Dear Val, who is also a mormon [or a parrots, 'ain't sure]

I found very strange that each time I am answering to one wikipedian/mormons question, it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to. 
I do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you, nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you. 
I think that the person concern, Storm Rider, is grown up enough to do so on its own. 
Unless next time I am under attack, you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. It could be interesting. 
If you have something to say, say it so, but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit, as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to don't know what to say. 
So do the wisest, just shut up! 
It is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed, and as you can see, repeating it indefinitely like rot speach, is not going to give you the ability to understand. 
All you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. 
Try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and I am sure that you might see some light. 
I do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction, more than a physical unhability to comprehend, expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. 
You cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. 
As for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie, what about you? Are you VAL? or are you rama? or are you DGL626, there is a lot of nick name on wiki, and all of them cover up a real name. 
They are all a pseudonym, meaning they are anonymous. 
So if I take the name """"anonymous"""" as a pseudo, I will be as hiding and as showing as you are, because at the end, in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.

So what are you trying to proove, except the fact that you were unable to figure what I just told you on your own? 
I had a name, this name seems now to be unavailable, and I dont feel to make it again or take another. 
Following wiki rules all are equal on wiki, old rats as well as newbees (hahaha) and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian, thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience, and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition, so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality, who is wikis first rule? 
It is all a lie. 
How can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group? 
It isnt equality it is power struggle. 
It is adversity, and supremacy and group pressure as here. 
WIKI is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression, it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view, on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equality!

HA HA! 
Make me laught, but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies. 
Please, in the future, avoid using words that you do not fully understand, as """"logic"""". 
For your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously, do some research first. 
I speak 9 languages: 
English, danish, french, german, norvegian, swedish, occitan, latin, greek, and geek!

5 of them fluently, the others as pocket use. Like german I can read a book but I dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me 2 3 weeks to get back the rythm. 
As a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero, maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the US, but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages. In europe from age 11 we choose between 3 languages: english german and spanish, at age 13, we have to chose another one, and choose between english german, spanish italian russian, from age 15, when we begin graduate school, we have to take another one, and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american, and a dialect or local language, and can also take hebrew. 
2 to 3 languages are part of the compulsory pensum. 
I also took extra english dialect as the one spoken by semi natives in australia, and english dialect spoken in India. 
That was for learning",0

My parents are/were Bangladeshis, and they were amongst the most wretched people I have ever had the misfortune of knowing; Indeed, during this unfortunate period of my life that I have been forced to spend in Bangladesh due to my father, I am now convinced that Bangladesh is the single most unworthy nation to exist.

Section on Turkey
Come on guys. The section on Turkey is highly biased and provides more space to the justification of Pelosi's attitude to the proposed bill on the so-called Armenian Genocide and doesn't give the other side to provide any justification why the Prime minister of Tuyrkey has negative attidue on this bill. I think that for the neuturality of this article, the section on Turkey shall be extended and editors shall give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue. 

Otherwise, this section seems like an election platform of ms. nancy prior to elections. 

I have been trying to extend this section, but pro-Nancy editors and probably her office staff are deleting all my additions without any justification.

""""Turkey
On October 11, 2007, regarding a proposed House resolution to label the 1915 killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as genocide, Pelosi said that the measure would be brought to a vote because """"While that may have been a long time ago, genocide is taking place now in Darfur, it did within recent memory in Rwanda, so as long as there is genocide there is need to speak out against it..."""" [27] Turkey's prime minister said that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.–Turkey relations. [28]""""""""  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 213.172.72.6   

Stop with the damn accusations of pro-nancy and elections. If you knew anything about American politics you would know how silly that sounds. You have been warned twice on your talk page to be civil and not use this talk page for a platform. You also have the ability to edit the page yourself, but I doubt you will be able to keep a neutral tone. Also, remember that this is a page about Nancy Pelosi and not about Turkey and and the Armenian Genocide.  

""""give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue""""? This is not the POV by Nancy Pelosi or US House of Representatives Committee, but a tragic event recognized by the most of democratic societies and countries. And surely this biographical article is not the right place for such an """"explanations of other side"""" (simple denial of the anti-human crime).  

Andranikpasha, your nickname expalins who are you? YOu are an armenianorigin person. Andranik indeed has been one ot he heads of the bloody Armenian militia killing Turks, Kurds and Azeris, with his terrorist acts has been the reason for the reaction of Kurds, Turks and Azeris after they returned from the war in 5 fronts. So your response is absolutly biased, because of your nationality and firm belief in an event that never occured or occurded only for the Armenian church who uses this so called armenian genocide to mobilzie armenians and prevent their assimilation. 

As to the fact this is not the page for the other side, this shows how much you are anti-democratic and biased on this issue. This is against the Wikip3edia neturality principle as well. You give one side an opportunity to jsutify her action, but the other side only one general and useless sentence. I wouldn't be surprised if you are a pro-Pelosi person. Please, don't accuse others with stupidity and etc. I know quite a lot about American politics and how it is run. I completed my studies in US. This is for your education and information. 

If I don't see any more jsutified response I will go an and extent the Turkey section and also create the Criticism section.

I don't wish to make a statement without any evidence to support it, but where I come from, everyone knows what the term 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant' means and what it represents so it's not unpopular. The acronym 'ISIL' is also accurate enough to represent the group. That being said, I have started to notice that both these terms are being displaced by 'ISIS', 'Islamic State' and 'IS' in publications that I read, and news that I tune in to. Many reliable sources are also starting to refer to it as 'Islamic State' with many many different variants. The other fact that also should be considered here is the actual wording in the name. 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant' makes the group sound as if it is geographically locked in these two regions, with no territory or ambition to spread outside of its primary spheres of influence. Similar to the Taliban-controlled Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. And, dare I say, it also makes them sound more legitimate as a group then just the ambiguous 'Islamic State' designation, due to the emphasis placed upon the areas of 'Iraq and the Levant'. Makes it sound more formal. But it is now not the case. As multiple editors have stated, it is not merely a parochial militant group with territory in the regions of Iraq, Syria and now even parts of Lebanon but a transnational entity bent on expansion. I cannot see how relegating it to two geographic positions is the mature thing to do in an Encyclopedia, whatever the intention. It is becuase of this that I do not believe the current name and its disambiguation is viable anymore, purely for this reason. Some editors had stated the potential and very real problem of justifying 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant' territory outside of Iraq and the Levant. It's not a recognized entity as far as I know. You cannot liken it to the Russian Federation having territory outside of Russia in Europe e.g Kaliningrad or the United States having territory outside of North America e.g Hawaii. What I am getting at is that this implies a level of legitimate ownership, and this group doesn't have it. Not in Libya or Yemen or Iraq or Syria or anywhere.

The issue I have with """"Islamic State (IS)"""" is the disambiguation which, whilst being a widely used acronym for the group, can not be measured accurately to satisfy WP:COMMONAME through Google searches alone. Even though many sources use 'IS' which has been stated, on its own as a disambiguation, it is simply too generic. A similar issue arises with the term """"Islamic State"""". However, were you to isolate the period for a search, the results would become more accurate, and this has already been stated. If a more appropriate disambiguation were to be found that could in concise terms explain what the article is about, I would support it. I suggest something along the lines of Islamic State (organisation) or Islamic State (ISIS) or Islamic State (group) or Islamic State (militant group). I am under the impression that WP:OFFICIAL and WP:COMMONAME are the important policies here, as editor  stated, and in my opinion the current title doesn't satisfy either, whilst a proposed title has the potential to satisfy both. 

The only reason why I choose to support this current proposal, is that progress towards a better article name will emerge allot quicker were it 'Islamic State (IS)' vs. a proposed alternative rather than the current title vs. a proposed alternative.

Sources on Medieval Croatia

Early medieval Croatian history fits the concluding line to the old jingle: the more you study the less you know. When I was and undergraduate studying Balkan history I thought I knew quite a bit about Croatia; but as I study more about Croatia, one by one """"facts"""" that I knew before turn out to be dubious, based on questionable sources or no sources at all. Most of the existing literature in western languages on medieval Croatia is extremely poor; and frequently it is marred by nationalistic bias.

Much of the information about medieval Croatian history comes from later (seveneenth- and eigteenth-century) narrative histories. These were written by enthusiastic people but ciontain a mixture of fact and legend; and since many of the documents they based their works on are now lost, it is extremely difficult to judge wheter their information came from reliable source or not.

Pages 33-34

One of Ladislaus's most significant achievements was the occupation of Hungary's southern neighbour, Croatia. ... The small kngdom, born in the tenth century, streched from the Kapela mountains to the Adriatic sea, its center being Biograd, located on the coast.

...
King Demetrius Zvonimir, who, not being a member of the ruling dynasty, obtained his throne throug election, asked Pope Gregory VII fo a crown in 1075, and, in return, declared his kingdom as a papal fief. After his death, Ladislaus laid claim on his realm by the right of his sister, Zvonimir's widow, and had no difficulty in taking possession of Croatia in 1091. He bestowed the new kingdom, together with royal title, on his nephew, Almos, son of Geza I ...

I further entertained myself reading yet another great discoveries of contemporary Croatian historians (soc.culture.yugoslavia) ....

The exclusive revelation is the result of """"scientific"""" research by Croatian historian Dragutin Pavlicevic, and found its place in history books. The Split newspaper """"Feral Tribune"""" reveals that Pavlicevic authored a chapter entitled """"Croatian Indians"""", included in the second grade history textbook, shedding new light on the history of native Americans and their ties with Croats, """"one of the oldest nations in Europe"""". He affirms that in North Carolina """"a tribe has been living for more than 4 centuries differing in the color of skin, hair and facial features from other tribes"""". According to the same historian this is not surprising because the members of these tribe """"have the noble blood of ancient Croats from Dubrovnik in their veins"""". Mr. Pavlicevic also speaks about the Mateo Indians, named after their ancestor Mateo - a Croat named Mate. """"In his work, Dragutin Pavlicevic stresses that he estimates that presently there are more than 2 million Croatian descendants throughout the United States"""", states the Split newspaper.

 Greek love 

I'm looking for a way to extricate myself honorably from this mess. I'm leaving a note here because you closed this AfD, where I made a commitment to do as you instructed in the closing statement. There are two editors who have long sought to delete or eviscerate the article, one of whom has used a series of user names (unacknowledged on his current user page but available , so at first glance it may appear on the talk page there are more than two editors in the 'suppress' camp). I complain here about their coordination. Other editors, including  and I simply can't do it any longer. I haven't changed my position on the validity of the article, but I've been accused (on various talk pages, and never the appropriate notice boards) of edit warring, ownership, disruption, and even pedophilia by implication, all for trying to carry out what the community decided. I'm done. I need to limit my time on Wikipedia at present, and wish for that time to be spent pleasantly and productively. When I've made a commitment, though, it grieves me not to keep it. I'm not asking you to do anything: I'm just explaining why I can't keep my word as given at the AfD.   

Wow, that is a mess.Certainly no hard feelings  on my end, it is clear you endeavored in good faith to improve the article. I have found that knowing when to walk away is an essential skill, not only here but in the real world. Sometimes your presence, despite your best intentions, is harmful rather than helpful, and sometimes a dispute just isn't worth it anymore. Best of luck in your future endeavors here.   

 Mailchimp 

I'm not that bothered but I think that the Mailchimp speedy deletion was a mistake.  It did cite that it was one of the more important email marketing programs so it was stating the importance - something that was supposed to be the original problem.

 Can there be a more concise listing? 

The listing of """"other inventions"""" is profoundly vague. Why group 4 different categories together? Why even mention things that the chinese received purely from outside sources? There should be a much more complete, well managed list of chinese developments, which I've yet to find- along with how these were transmitted globally, and whether or not places like Europe got them purely from the Chinese.

This really needs the attention of people with some remote expertise, which I guess is somewhat there when Needham's work, which is profoundly rare in private collections was cited- not like the arrogant bigoted ass who was crying about chinese nationalism, yet then went onto say that they only invented noodles.

28414,28414,"Hi Hanna Simpson. Thank you for the message. I tried to clean up the references you added. Just for reference, there's nothing wrong with citing non-English sources as long as they satisfy WP:RS, but if you do then it's sometimes helpful to provide a brief translation of the relevant section per WP:RSUE. This can be added to the citation template using the  parameter (See Template:Cite web#Quote). Translations do not have to be professional quality; They just have to be sufficient enough for the reader to understand how the cited source supports what is written in the article. 
Regarding COI, you are considered to have a conflict of interest because you have stated you are an employee of the museum at User talk:Materialscientist#Ottoneum. That doesn't mean you can never edit the article, but it does mean there are certain limitations placed the type of edits which are considered OK for you to make. COI editing is not expressly prohibited, but it can be a bit tricky to do so it is something which is highly discouraged. It might be a good idea for you to take a look at WP:PSCOI to see what these kinds of edits are. Of course, what you know about the museum is true, but what can be verified through independent reliable sources matters more to Wikipedia than what we may personally know about a particular subject. The information on the museum's official website is considered to be a primary source, so it's usage is rather limited. Wikipedia articles are not really supposed to reflect what a source says about itself or what those connected to the source say about it; Rather, articles are supposed to reflect what independent reliable sources say about something. So, any sources you can find which discuss the museum and are independent of it would be helpful.",0

 From women's basketball to AAC to Ruddy Shelducks (with an SI sidetrack) 

Did you ever watch Connections (TV series)?

I was reminded of it today.

I've been working on articles on basketball coaches, which led to wanting  to see who will be in the American Athletic Conference next season, which led me to wodnering who wrote that well-researched article, so I decided to see who was working on it, which led me to you.

I noticed that Sarah left you a note indicating she was involved with the Smithsonian; I have a to-do item to talk to someone abut the Terms of Use of the Smithsonian, so I think I will contact Sarah.

I noticed you have a lot of interest in birds, and I'm trying to figure out how to respond to an OTRS email which involves birds, so here goes. Someone has provided an image that they believe are Ruddy Shelducks in Texas, and believes that is unusual. We aren't, as you know, into OR, and simply reporting that this is a photo of the bird in Texas feels ORish. But I'm out of my depth, so wondered if you had some thoughts.(Talk) """,0

It is the same with Martin Luther King. While each of these people were Civil Rights leaders who were assassinated they were also human activists attempting to make the world a better place who were murdered.

Speedy deletion of Jacob Silver
 A tag has been placed on Jacob Silver requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

This body of air has to be large (many chord lengths in diameter, say five or more), for the effects of the airfoil on the boundary to be small enough to be negligible (from a practical point of view; a case which not satisfies this is the ground effect where the boundary influences the kinematics and forces).    11:21, 28""",0

Robert Deegan 
General Liability Claims Section
Los Angeles Unified School District
333 S Beaudry Ave  28th Floor 
Los Angeles CA 90017  

Dear Mr. Deegan:

This letter shall constitute a claim pursuant to the California Tort Claims Act, Section 910 et seq of the California Government Code.

My address information in compliance with Section 910(a) and (b) is set forth above.

Per Section 910(c), (d) and (e), the date of occurrence was October 5, 2007.  I was assaulted and battered by students T and I and possibly other students at Markham Middle School, 145 W 108th Street, Los Angeles.  The Police Report is DR#071828895.

LAUSD personnel, specifically, Steven Thomas Rooney, aided and abetted violations of the Ralph and Bane Civil Rights Acts, Sections 51.7, 52 and 52.1 of the California Civil Code and Sections 242, 245, and 422.6 of the California Penal Code, by failing and refusing to report the matter to police authorities.  LAUSD violated my rights under Article I, Section One of the California Constitution to safety and my specific right to safety on a school campus under Article I, Section 28 of the California Constitution.  I have suffered physical damages and extreme emotional trauma as a result.

David Brewer and other personnel knew or should have known based upon my complaints and upon past known misconduct by Rooney that Rooney was unfit as a supervisory employee of LAUSD.  LAUSD therefore negligently hired, trained, assigned, supervised and retained Rooney and ignored my complaints about his misconduct.

LAUSD’s conduct towards me is motivated by benign neglect of complaints of discrimination, retaliation, and harassment by Latino employees, as exemplified in past incidents by Superintendent Brewer and the General Counsel’s office failing to properly investigate and take appropriate action when complaints were levelled against anti-Hispanic ethnocentric misconduct against an attorney employed by the Office of the General Counsel, and other incidents.

Pursuant to Section 910(f) this claim is for damages within the jurisdiction of the unlimited division of the Los Angeles Superior Court.

Respectfully Submitted,

Migdia Chinea

While speaking via a loudspeaker and wearing a red coat, in front of a physician's home which the Israelis intended to bulldoze, Corrie fell down. A bulldozer then ran over her twice. Later, as a group of people gathered, a man was shot and killed by the Israel Defence Forces. 

Corrie was a senior at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington.""""

A week after she was killed:
""""Rachel Corrie (1979 - March 16, 2003) was an American peace activist who was crushed to death while attempting to block an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) bulldozer in a Gaza Strip refugee camp.

Corrie grew up in Olympia, Washington, and graduated from Capital High School. She had been a senior at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, where she studied the arts and international relations. She took a leave of absence to participate in resistance against the IDF as a member of the Palestinian-led International Solidarity Movement (ISM). In her home town, she was known in the local peace movement and an active member of the Olympia Movement for Justice and Peace.

Friends describe Corrie as athletically slender with blond hair and thoughtful, intelligent eyes. She played soccer, gardened and loved the poems of Pablo Neruda. She was the daughter of Craig Corrie, an insurance executive, and Cindy Corrie, a school volunteer and flutist.""""

""""Rachel Corrie (April 10, 1979 - March 16, 2003 was a member of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) who was run over and killed by an Israeli soldier operated bulldozer while she was protesting Israeli demolitions of Palestinian homes in Rafah in the Gaza Strip.

 Marduk = Abraham. 

The early prophet line is reflected in all the history of the world.

Marduk is a regional variant of Abraham. So is Zoroaster.

Adam as we know him, was the first prophet of Dyeus, and the first human consciousness we see in history. Dyeus, became Zeus, Jupiter (with piter from fertilitycult distortions) and Yah, etc. """"God"""" ofcourse for many.
Idris was the second prophet of Tengri, which became """"Thor"""" many places sometimes god, sometimes more of a prophet, and again """"Indra"""", """"Prometheus"""", """"Osiris"""".
These concepts are known everywhere with local variations.
Knowing the regional names, one can see the same change in the regions who talk about Marduk, as here. A change from early prophetic teachings, to that of Abraham.

And Sarai of the Bible, is Saraswati in Hinduism, and Sarpanit here. Obviously we all have the same prophetic line, teaching monotheism. - God is without others.

In true BWilkins style though, someone else has to take his nonsense blocks to their inevitable conclusion . So take your bow Reaper Eternal, there's a good lad.

So here goes, BWilkins presumably blocked me because he thought I was about to OUT someone, yet in his incompetence failed to lock this page, so.....drum roll......User:Mo ainm used to be User:BigDunc, the account that 'retired' and never went back to editting the same articles, pulling the same stunts, or so the public record would have you believe.

Yes, that's the super secret information that the esteemed *arbitrator* Elen of the Roads thinks should be permanently stricken from the record, even though he's now the very conspicuous last man standing of a clique of Irish Republican editors who have been skewing Wikipedia articles for YEARS using the same despicable tactics, and are only now starting to be noticed by the sloths who work AE and be dealt with as appropriate (or 'retire' as they see the wriitng on the wall for their hard won 'reputations' as editors in 'good standing' who never got noticed by the dumbshits who are supposed to monitor editors for compliance with all policies, not just the easy ones).

Mo survives due in no small part to the fact that none of his mates ever had the good fortune of getting away with a mid-life secret change of identity, as well as the general cowardice of people like BWilkins, who usually run a mile rather than deal with something complex like GAMEing on Irish republican related articles. Nope, that's far too much like work for that lazy prick.

This change of identity is being covered up by Elen on the grounds of OUTing. Yes, that's right, Elen wants to stake her reputation on a patently ridiculous claim that knowing that Mo ainm is really a bloke called Duncan who lives in Ireland, is a violation of WP:OUTING, just to cover up the fact that she never bothered to verify whether this was 100% grade A bullshit before she started blocking people for calling it as such, those who were there at the beginning and know just exactly how this lucky cunt came to have this excuse land in his lap and save him from a complete FAIL in understanding what is and is not a CLEANSTART.

So here we are, with sponge brained morons like Reaper and detestible assholes like BWilkins continuing the farce with blocks and censures like this. So well done guys. Assuming neither of you has the backbone to do the necessary and end this farce once and for all by calling Elen out on her lies, one of you has to now ensure this post gets oversighted so she can continue this OUTing bullshit story of hers to cover her own incompetent deceitful ass. (ab)use of oversight is logged, so it's at least good to have more names added to the list of people who've enabled this bullshit for so long anyway, it was starting to look like a one woman crusade.

FGR#11 is interesting and gives some insight into how this bureaucratic world functions. A couple of things I noted. The table of p28 shows a good dozen elements (including Ca) where the values changes by well over and order of magnitude from on """"model"""" to the next. The following summary on p29  says: """"for about 70% of radionuclides, the differences are not substantial, ie., less than a factor of four. 

That points out that none of these figures are derived from actual physical measurements but from computer models. Also there is no qualification on the uncertainty of these values as one would expect if it was a scientific test (which it is not , it's a model) . The magnitude of the changes and that fact that a factor of 4 is seen as """"not substantial"""" gives an idea of how reliable the number may or may not be.

I don't know what the exchange rate for K is, but it is prsesent in signif-
icant amounts in the urine, at concentrations that vary comparatively widely.
This would suggest, I suppose, that the body regulates K very closely, disposingof excess amounts very rapidly.  Perhaps someone should do a study by feeding

I have found this """"Banana Equivalent Dose"""" very useful in attempting to
explain  infinitesmal doses (and corresponding infinitesmal risks) to members
of the public.  (Interestingly, the anti-nukes just HATE this, and severely
critisize us for using such a deceptive concept.)

Would love to go into more detail, but have to get back to our DEADLY Human
Radiation Experiments (i.e., eating bananas.)

Considering the fact that the DOE has officially stated that """"there is no safe
dose of radiation"""" my advice to you all is to stop eating immediately.

Disclaimer:

Neither Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the University of California,
nor the Department of Energy recommends eating bananas.

So it seems the advocates of this BED idea do regard it as a bit of an insider joke, and take joy in using it to be provocative. 

But if the K-40 in a banana is 400 times more potent than that already in muscle tissue there is still a """"substantial"""" problem somewhere. 

At least this is getting closer to understanding where it comes from and how it is calculated.""",0

12538,12538,"Absolute Proof that 0.999... IS NOT EQUAL TO 1 
A math-wiki:

You are wrong about infinite representation. The ancient Greeks *never* represented 1/3 as 0.333... 

Now let me refute your argument regarding the transitive property:

A)    1=3(1/3)
B)    3(1/3) = 3(0.333...)
C)    3(0.333...) =0.999... 

The problem here occurs in B) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. 
0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any
radix system.

You mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r
such that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then 
what are the integers q and r such that the above is true?

Suppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.
For example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the
division algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times.

Now suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:

1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!!

hey warrens, fuck you too. """"Uncivil manner, means me trying to elaborate on my arguments and getting  revert on revert that's what uncivil means. So yeah your a big winner champ and won't get banned. Asshole. 

Since the vista article contains information about the anti trust situation which, since it seems some people here have got a mouthful of gate's balls, is mislabelled anti trust controversy. Not really a controversy though is it when a court elected by over two hundred million people issues a decision, it'a court ruling, like it or not there's no controversy too that. Otherwise we should renaim the ted bundy trial, to the tend bundy controversy, since any court ruling merits this label. 

Since there's a section on anti trust laws and vista, it's worth noting the recent news that microsoft are going to be paying a hefty daily fine for completely ignoring the court's injuction. And this does have bearing on vista. You can't quote the m.s. pr saying we don't know what they want us to do, it's all questions, or whatever else he mentioned, without an adjunct sentence, of the head official regulating the anti trust actions quoting him too saying that our injuctions are crystal clear yet ms has ignored them for over two years now. 

But of course this has no bearing if this article is supposed to be a showcase for vista.

So like i said, if some fuckers had gone into the trouble of actually discussing any of that instead of reverted every single edit in a hitleric fashion, things would be different.

But for now this stategy of being a hawk on an article I wish to keep in a certain way, and being completely uncivil and rude about it, merits from my part a roayl, fuck y's all, take your mouths off of gate's balls and then we can talk.

I'm only answering this because I'm really bored, excruciatingly so, and I also find it kind of amusing. People writing and, or, approving of psychologically harmful disinformation, that starving girls read, including the expressed desire to include a potentially triggering image of such a starving girl, illicits no response whatsoever. A collapsible box however, seems to be somehow construed as a threat to  civilization. One inane comment after another becomes somewhat irritating. 
Despite only having a ninth grade education, I actually did learn how to read. I also learned the proper use of Latin phrases, e.g.; id est (i.e) and exempli gratia (e.g.). For example, or to use an abbreviation of a Latin phrase, e.g.; ...in article text, i.e., how they were recently used here. Should have been e.g., not, i.e.. That being said, I read this:  
MOS:COLLAPSE:Scrolling lists and boxes that toggle text display between hide and show are acceptable for use, but should not be used in article prose.  This includes reference lists, image galleries, and image captions; Collapsible sections are useful in ,infoboxes, or to consolidate information already covered in prose.

This is not prose:
Candidate genes include dopamine transporter, dopamine receptors D2/D3,[46] dopamine beta-hydroxylase monoamine oxidase A, catecholamine-methyl transferase, serotonin transporter promoter (SLC6A4), 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2A), 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B receptor (5-HT1B),[47] the 10-repeat allele of the DAT1 gene,[48] the 7-repeat allele of the DRD4 gene,[48] and the dopamine beta hydroxylase gene (DBH TaqI).[49]

Your alleged concern over compliance with WP:ACCESS is unwarranted and seems to be self serving. It says nothing about """"Collapsible boxes"""". As I stated in an aforementioned paragraph, anorectic kids reading about death, mortality and suicide after enjoying a triggering look at an inappropriate image should be a cause for concern not """"Collapsible boxes"""".

Hi again Cat, 

as perviously I have noticed a strong anti-Greek bias on several articles related to Macedonia. I've had issues with both Furper and Beam... who seem to be admins that heavily favour FYROM. I've officially complained on the notice board about their threats to block, edit behavior and unusually close relationships with obvious FYROM POV members of Wikipedia.  (specifically Balkanfever) 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#This_anon_.28apparently_User:Crossthets.29.2C_is_an_apparent_POV_Pusher.2C_evidence_below

As I said verbatim on Politis talk_page...

This is a difficult battle because so far I am alone at the moment, I am a newbie, and as I said to one of the admins on notice board... I feel like someone reporting a bad cop at a policeman's ball.  However, I still plan to follow up soon with a precise listing of what I perceive as non-NPOV behavior by these admins. I noticed while researching this issue you've also have problems with them. Would it be possible to list any problems on your talk page here so I can add them to my report to show I am not alone? Furthermore... since you have been around longer you probably know more Greeks than me around here. Would it be possible to also contact them to ask them if they've also had problems with those two... and (if so) add those incidents to your list?  (and perhaps get them to contact others?)

Theoretically, polygamy can assume any one of three possible forms: polygyny or the marriage of one man to two or more wives at a time, polyandry or the coexistent union of one woman with two or more men, and group marriage or a marital union embracing at once several men and several women.  Of these, only the first is common.

And on page 25 

A statistical analysis of Kaingang genealogies for a period of 100 years showed that 8 per cent of all recorded unions were group marriages, as compared with 14 per cent for polyandrous, 18 per cent for polygynous, and 60 per cent for monogamous unions.

An interesting comment:  """"Convict leasing isn't the same as slavery where there's ownership and title. However, I would agree that we could amend the lead to read: """"effectively abolished slavery...""""

True there is a difference with chattel slavery and forced prison slave labour. One ended w/ the 13th amendment, and the other was legalised under the 13th amendment (not the Corwin Amendment of 1861). In other words, what would be the legal justification for the prison labour in California, Oregon and other states that practise this form of human rights abuse without the """"involuntary servitude"""" clause? WWhat do you think they were referring to? 

Futhermore, I don't see a problem including this in the article, so long as it is a small reference, and not the focus of the article. As to scholarship, there is reputable work on this, and there is no doubt that starting in 1866 the prison chain gangs were leased to private business, plantations, mines etc for being picked up for the most frivilous charges. Yes they were mostly black. The mortality rate was higher than chattel slavery because they were leased and not owned. Virtual life sentences on absurd charges directed against black people w/ forced labour is slavery, though not chattel. This was systematic and went on until WW2, though today's version is slightly different. Now, some of you asked for refrences and rightly so. Slavery by Another Name by Douglas Blackmon, who is a respected writer & journalist and received the Pulitzer Prize for this book which is on this very topic. That's the point. This is FAR from original research, and there are other scholars who've written about it. Now I haven't edited the article nor will I unless there is some agreement w/ others editors here, but I'd like to know the issue as it is now. How do other editors feel? 

One other thing, American historians do not always agree on things, and I have noticed at least one conspicious neo-Confederate argument in the article (unsourced), though on a different part of the article. So yes it's important to look at historians, but on some topics there's a whole lot of rubbish, particularly w/ slavery issues, so a consensus by historians may never happen, and sadly ideological agendas do exist, and I understand what you blokes mean about good sources. I'd say that keeping this article from vandalism is far more important.  15:00, 18 July""",0

 DJ Peterson 

The link you added on the DJ Peterson page is broken.  Also, the information you added is incorrect.  Zunino was drafted 3rd overall.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.16.215.84   
 I fixed the link. Also, the information was initially correct when I first added it, but a later edit made the sentence incorrect: Peterson is the highest drafted player in New Mexico Lobos history, not Mariners. 24Mati 

 Your revert of my edit on the page about Roblox 

I should have cited my other sources. Those include Youtube, and items on Roblox (decals, models)

Youtube 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJEJNoxoiIQ
Youtube 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBkDFv0WR5o
Youtube 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLy5FCJZIng
Decal 1: http://www.roblox.com/April-Fools-Smile-item?id=76579753

  
 YouTube videos are not considered reliable, as anyone can upload a video and make a claim. The Decal is also not a reliable source, since the description itself is not enough, and like YouTube, self-published sources are not considered reliable. For the hacking incident, the only way for it to be mentioned here is through either a reliable source, like a news group, or by the developers itself. I believe the game's developers have a blog, which can be accessed from the site itself, and if one of the developers wrote a blog entry about it (a passing mention is not notable), it can be added. 24Mati 

 Erm, here the blog: http://blog.roblox.com/2012/04/april-1st-site-issue-and-update/ — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 
 Alright, thanks for providing it. While the blog does mention the eventual shutdown due to """"site issues"""", I doubt it'll be enough to be added to the article, since one who's new to Roblox and reading the page would believe it was just for routine maintenance, when it was much worse; David Baszucki didn't say exactly what the cause was, which - in the case of the videos - was various hackings, it seems, and you can't add in details that the source doesn't provide. For the most part, if you can find another blog post from the developers, or a reliable source (as I said, a news agency, for example), that actually explains what happens, then it might merit inclusion. 24Mati 

 Found a source. http://roblox.wikia.com/wiki/April_Fools_Hack_2012?file=Ropacalypse.png Proof of moderatorship: https://twitter.com/BrianReddus & http://www.roblox.com/User.aspx?ID=34300. — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 
 Twitter and Wikia usually are not reliable sources, especially the latter, like Wikipedia. As I had said, if you can find a reliable source, like a news agency, that discusses the hackings in detail, then it might be considered. Blog posts from anyone not affiliated with Roblox, profiles and tweets are not enough. 24Mati

Dear EdJohnston,

 Please find UST Global leadership team in the link http://www.ust-global.com/leadership.aspx
Do you really want to have external links that have outdated/wrong info about an article in Wikipedia? Wiki is an Encyclopedia which is most popular in the world and widely used for collecting accurate information about anything under the sun. Anyway Business Week has updated the content to the actual facts about the leadership team of UST Global. FYI the link to the same http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4298931. I think now you might have understood why I was removing this link before.

 Can I ask you to check few pages in Wikipedia itself regarding UST Global content and find what i am trying to say here? This is very important. Could you please check the link http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UST_Global&limit;=500&action;=history.

This link takes you to the earliest revision history page of UST Global. Please find when this page was initially drafted and when did the user Steve Ross started editing the page. This wikipedia page was started in 2005 and Steve came in to picture by 2007. The most interesting thing here you can find is the first few edits by Steve Ross. He added himself as co-founder of UST where right now he wants to mention himself as founder of the company. Don’t you find that this user is inconsistent with his edits and this proves that his intention is to advertise himslef? Also could you please check whether this user has contributed anything else in this Wiki page other than adding his name in different roles of UST Global?

All you want to know about UST Global is available in their website (www.ust-global.com).
Also I want to repeat here that I am not here to violate any rules or policies of Wikipedia. I just want to point out the anomalies in this Wiki page. Could you please listen to my request. This is genuine.",0

Hi David,

Thanks for taking the time to write such a thoughtful analyis at Talk:DepoProvera. (And for reminding me it's Guy Fawkes!)

I feel that I don't need to assure you that I will not be offended in any way if you restate your position from our earlier discussion re Pfizer/LaCroix/BMD in the current disputebut just in case, please be assured that I will not.  It might actually be helpful to have other people than Mastcell and I making the argumentsperhaps more input should be solicited elsewhere, as well, if not enough editors contribute in a week or two week's time.

I will be slow-to-respond/disengaged on the Depo talkpage, in hopes of keeping things cool, while still continuing to advance the discussion. There is no hurry and deadline, after all.:-)

I don't know if you've been following the discussion at Emergency Contraception, but MastCell's first post to Depo occurred less than 30 minutes after the conclusion of this exchange: . It seems unfair to accuse him of harassment or wikistalking, but it also seems to me that he arrived at Depo already quite upset/confrontational, etc.    Because there is even the possibility that there is a causal relationshipi.e., he is angry re EC page and following me to Depo, (and Dalkon Shield) to express animosity, I think it is better that the Depo discusssions involve plenty of input from other editors.

Any tank that has to maneuvre around at close range to the sides and rear of an opposing tank to score a kill is definitely not good. The only notable good Sherman at the end of the war is the VC Firefly, but because US Ordinance doubted the 17 pounder could be fitted onto the tank, it was manufactured in limited quantities. 

The only notable features of the Sherman was that it was produced in large quantities, had a mechanical reliability that beat the T-34, and came with better secondary equipment such as FM Radio and an elevation gyro-stabiliser.

Not to mention the extremely sad stories behind it. Once, a Sherman maneuvered around a building to hide from a Tiger tank. The Tiger shot at the building, and the shell went right through and penetrated the Sherman's turret. There are also tales of German tanks who take out two aligned Shermans in one shot. Also, do you know why you see all these wartime photos of crewmen who have Shermans with spare road wheels and tracks welded onto the hull?

What we now for certaint is: The composistion of the Soviet major combat formations where pressent, they Soviet was reinforced by 100 tanks and SPG before the battle, and during the battle 21 Soviet army sent more of its formation in to the battle. 

This contradics any statment of withdraw to other fronts or the redicules low figure as only 60000 Soviet red army men.

What about Tbma sources?

The Sources of 60000 men from """"Punaiset panssarit - Puna-armeijan panssarijoukot 1918-1945"""" is by no mean to be seen as a final statment over the battle as the book is abour red army tank, and just uses a few phrases on the Tali-Ihantala battle.

I am sorry to say Mr.Tosa was not invited to that championship. So what you are telling is not true. Sensei Shukumine never had any contact with Tosa after Tosa turned his back on him and started his own commercial Karate organization. Please see also Sensei Shukumine's personal message at a training seminar in The Netherlands with Sensei Kanai and Sensei Konno. Please see the pictures on the Genseiryu website: Taido and Genseiryu people united to celebrate 55 years Genseiryu - 40 years Taido and to commemorate Sensei Shukumine. Besides that there are pictures of Sensei Shukumine teaching several Genseiryu Teachers like Genseiryu Head Instructor Sensei Kanai in Genseiryu Head dojo situated in Ito Japan in 1996. 212.127.137.2 19:37, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Were you at the championship or something? 
So, if Mr. Tosa never had any contact with Mr. Shukumine after 1962, then please explain these picturse of Mr. Tosa and Mr. Shukumine together on the Brazilian Genseiryu website .  Zzaroc 22:01, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I am sorry I didn't say Sensei Shukumine had any contact after 1962. I said he didn't had any contact after Sensei Tosa turned his back to Sensei Shukumine. This was after Sensei Shukumine wrote the preface for sensei Tosa's book about Genseiryu Butokukai. And yes I was present at the championship in Okinawa amongst other Genseiryu practitioners from Spain, Denmark, Holland, and Japan. I will try to give also a link with pictures of that event. I need a little time for that I am not an Internet black belt sorry for that. 212.127.137.2 22:53, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

You don't have to be a black belt, when your good, by the way. But take your time, I am patient.
But I was wondering. Mr. Tosa published his book in 1984, but there still a picture of him together with Mr. Shukumine in 1985 (I mean those pictures on the Brazilian site). Then there are still a few questionmarks.
But by the way, did you know that Mr. Tosa received several letters all over the world, just after Mr. Shukumine died? Those letters were asked for permission if some dojo's could join the organization of Mr. Tosa. Mr. Tosa denied these people to join his organization.
There was one person who send such a letter to Mr. Tosa from Holland, and you may guess who.
And I have got also another question. Mr. Seiken Shukumine past away to an hart attack. But when did he started to get ill?  Zzaroc 23:59, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

No a black belt is not needed to have a certain skill. But in most occasion it shows an amount of training effort,time. And as you probably know training effort makes you become more skillfull.

I don't know when Mr. Tosa turned his back to sensei Shukumine so maybe my remark that they didn't had any contact shouldn't be done by me because I am not aware of that specific date. So I apologize for that. But I heard this occured in the mid till end '80s.

No, I didn't know that Mr. Tosa received several letters from all over the world. I know he claimed to get a letter from Holland. I know he received one which was delivered by someone from Denmark. But I know that the letter was completely different from what is claimed by Mr. Tosa. That is also easy to believe if you are member of a Genseiryu organization in Ito which was directly connected to sensei Shukumine where Sensei Shukumine still gave, in very few occasions, lectures about Genseiryu (pictures are on the way (few days necessary)). So you can imagine you don't beg for acknowledgement by Mr. Tosa who only wants you to train his way, which is very near to Shotokan with the basic kata of Shotokan. This dojo in Holland is not interested in any connection with Mr. Tosa. For what reason, if you want to train Genseiryu the same way as sensei Shukumine taught his students? The Head Instructor of this organization is now Sensei Kanai one of the first students of Sensei Shukumine. In Sensei Shukumine's book """"Shin Karatedo Kyohan"""" there are several pictures of teachers who are still in this group. I met them during the celebrating anniversary of Taido and Genseiryu beginning of this year (Jan. 2005). Many nice teachers who still respect Sensei Shukumine, as should be in the relationship with teacher and student.

I was never involved with the sickness of Sensei Shukumine and I don't like to talk about his sickness. I met Mr. Shukumine one time and talked a little bit with him. In Okinawa I only met him from a distance. So I am sorry I can't anwer this question for I didn't have such a close relationship with Sensei Shukumine.  212.127.137.2 06:48, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

(deindent) Sorry for kibitzing, but I wanted to be fair to all points of view, even those of the dualists. so I tried to stick to presenting the thought experiments without drawing conclusions.

The thought experiment is this:

 you have one observer
 The observer gets cloned into copy 1 and copy 2 (either Hubert/Yorick or star-trek style)
 The copies diverge, either because of internal noise, or because of the environment

From a third person point of view, this is an objective description of the evolution of a physical system, there is absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on- one observer becomes two. If probed, each copy would say that they were the initial observer before the cloning event. But viewed from the inside, if you are the observer getting cloned, there is a very natural question you can ask: Am I going to end up being copy 1 or am I going to be copy 2? This question cannot even be formulated from the outside, so it has no objective answer, but it is subjectively very important if you are the observer.

This scenario is Dennett's (and to some extent Everett's). Since the question doesn't even make sense when formulated in the third person perspective, the answer to this question does not lie in the position and velocities of any atoms. You might conclude that this question doesn't make any sense. But, in any case, the answer to this question is 1 bit of subjective information which both copy 1 and copy 2 know, and which the original observer does not. In the objective third person view, there is no information gained- you know that copy 1 will say """"I am copy 1"""" and copy 2 will say """"I am copy 2"""".

To give an example of actual OR and SYNTH, I'll go beyond Dennett's example: suppose that the copying goes on indefinitely, so that the cloning keeps happening again and again. Then it is very difficult to say what it feels like for the observer, from the first person perspective. For example, take a star-trek duplicator, and duplicate the observer, and then duplicate each duplicate, but add a twist: the duplicator keeps the data from the first duplication event in its memory banks, and makes a third copy in the exact same state twenty years later, and starts duplicating that observer too in the same way. And then it does so again forty years later, then sixty years later. What is the subjective experience? From a naive counting perspective, I should predict that I would be nearly certainly teleported in time to some distant future point, because the number of future copies of my present state is vastly greater than the two present copies. On the other hand, the total number of observers descended from the current duplicates will always outnumber the observers descended from the future duplicates. So perhaps the right counting is by the number of descendents at each time slice, rather than by the total number of descendents of my present state. Even worse, how can my subjective experience change depending on whether somebody millions of years in the future turns off the darned duplicator? (Boltzmann's brain is a similar idea).  """,0

Hello Vert,

I was just doing a cleanup of Clearcut, and noticed your picture entitled Rouge_clearcut.jpg. The caption read: """"Water rushing down a Rouge Valley slope in Alberta, Canada. This clearcutting action was done for the Hwy 407 East Partial extension rather than to facilitate the regrowth of a new stand"""". I was just curious about where you got the info on the shot because the Rouge Valley and Hwy 407 are in Ontario, not Alberta, and the picture sure doesn't look like a forest anywhere near the Rouge or hwy 407. It does look like Alberta, at the coordinates listed, however. It also doesn't show water rushing down a slope.

To BIL: Guadeloupe and French Guiana are not inside the Schengen area because this would e.g. require France to equip the complete rain forest border between French Guiana and Suriname, Brasil etc. with high-tech infrared sensors which would detect every monkey which is crossing the border - just in order to avoid ID checks on flights between there and Europe. I can understand why they do not invest any money into this.",0

 Bruce Lee flexing his muscles in the 1972 movie Way of the Dragon. Frontal shot 

Good day, Shawnc I were wondering about the photo you updated """"Bruce Lee flexing his muscles in the 1972 movie Way of the Dragon. Frontal shot"""" I think this is your best work yet this is the picture that truly shows Bruce Lee's physique. I were wondering if you have the same picture but in a bigger resolution or could you tell me where to get it.    Thanks, Maikeo""",0

Listen, you're just like every other forum mod and admin out there. In real life, you're probably just some typical, anonymous 9-5 jobber. And you make up for your lack of authority by becoming a big shot on the internet. You leave me condescending messages in which you refer to me as """"son"""" and accuse my accurate information of being """"vandalism"""".

You denied me my right to post relevent and pertinent trivia on the page in favor of templates and interfaces.

4784,4784,"""THIS YOUTUBE ACCOUNT IS THE ONLY REAL GOLDENTONY111 ACCOUNT. A MORONIC TROLL HAS SET UP ACCOUNTS ON THE WEB WITH MY USERNAME & FALSE IDS, WHICH AREN'T ME BUT A CHILDISH ATTEMPT TO INTIMIDATE ME WITH SLURS & A FAKE PHOTO. CHECK JOIN DATE; 2006 NOT 2011. HE IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION & SO WORRIED ABOUT IT HE IS CREATING ACCOUNTS ASKING IF HE COULD BE IN TROUBLE. HE IS. THE ONLY REAL GOLDENTONY111/112 ACCOUNTS ARE ON HERE.

Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of:
1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality).
2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree.
3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs.
4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on.
5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times.
6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

I encourage debate, NOT bickering, childish playground taunts or interminable clowns on their soapbox refusing to listen to others. It is still possible to get a viewpoint across without resorting to actions a 5 year old would sneer at.

These types are incredibly easy to expose for what they are, they do half the job themselves and not one of them has yet """"defeated"""" me or shut me up. Not only do I have the majority on my side but also facts and common sense.....they have none of this. I don't proclaim to be intelligent, but I certainly have the majority of int",1
